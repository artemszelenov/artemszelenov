# ✌️ Hi, my name is Artem
I am a Frontend Developer with 7+ years of experience.

I am passionate about building custom MVPs and getting feedback from users as fast as possible.

I like open source. I actively discuss and test new tools, give feedback to developers. I help not only with words, but also with actions: my PR to [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/76397).
